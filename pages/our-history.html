                <h1>Our History</h1>
                <p>
                    Since its inception before 1385 DR, The Driftwood Tavern, 
                    currently under the management of Madame Rosene (picture), has woven a rich and varied history.
                    Not only did it withstand the tumultuous events of the Spellplague and the eruption of Mount Hotenow, 
                    but it takes pride in emerging almost unscathed. After the eruption in 1451 DR, Madame Rosene repurposed the tavern, 
                    turning it into a refuge for refugees. It also served as a meeting place and makeshift city 
                    hall during the turbulent years preceding Dagult Neverember's reclamation of Neverwinter. <br>

                    Around 1479 DR, The Driftwood Tavern became an unofficial headquarters for the Graycloaks, 
                    playing a significant role in their activities. <br>
                    In 1488 DR, during a lively night at the tavern, 

                    Regis joined the festivities and had notable encounters with various characters, including Artemis Entreri, 
                    who later confronted him about a lack of secrecy. <br>
                    Moving to the late 1490s DR, 
                    
                    the tavern became a focal point for intrigue during Neverwinter's High Sun Games. 
                    Thieves, attempting to infiltrate Castle Never, found their plans disrupted by Jil Torbo, 
                    a member of the Absolution Council. Despite a tense encounter with the Neverwinter Guard, 
                    the thieves managed to escape, leaving a mark on the tavern's rich history.<br>
